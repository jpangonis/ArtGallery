This project involes making a secure art gallery. There are two files to run. LogAppend adds new information to a specified log. LogRead reads information from a specified log. 

TO RUN:

Download the crypto++ library found here: https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/tree/34a34967ac560c1801bf3845dbac3ac63c1d4c05

To run on visual studio IDE: From [Visual Studio->Solution Explorer] click on [Solution->Add->Existing Project] and select the cryptlib.vcproj file to include in your solution. Build and run the application. Note, there are two main files here so it is likely one will have to be commented out.
